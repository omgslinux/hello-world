# hello-world

I'm sysadmin with medium-high php knowledge, together with bash and other programming skills for server administration.

At this time, after many years using "raw" php for different personal projects, now I'm on the way to getting a decent skill with symfony, so I can provide a better look & feel to apps, together with other layers as security, db integration, integrated code revisions, etc. So, for this, I've finally decided to join github and start developing some projects I've had in my mind for a long time.

Now, this readme in hello-world, is just to follow the basic starting tutorial for github starters and make sure I do my first thing in github "the right way".
